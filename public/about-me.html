  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, i'm Yael Globman.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a graduate of the Technion- institute of technology in israel, 
    from the Computer-Science faculty. 
    During my studies i worked as a backend developer on Spot.io, 
    and when i finished my studings i worked on a full position at Cropx as a backend engineer. 
  </p>
  
  <p>When my first son, Tsuf, has born- I understood I need to make a change in my career.
    I had time to think and I realized two things: that I'm not really enjoy my work as a bachend developer, 
    I find it boring and I want a job that I'll be happy to do, and that I will not need to force myself 
    to to go to work everydaym I want a job that I'll enjoy to do and will want to do. 
    Also, on high-tech industry in Israel we supposed to work from the morning to the evening every day.
    I understood it's not suits for me now that I'm a mother.
    I want a job that will let me to work from home and that will be flexible about the working-hours,
    synce Tsuf is the most important to me and I want to spend time with him.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I decided to lean web development. 
    I found it really interesting and enjoyable, by far more satisfying than backend engineering,
    and the best part of it- I can be freelance developer and be responsible on my working-hours,
    so this way I can combine working with quelity time with Tsuf.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I learn web development from course on Udemy, and I enjoy every minute of it.
    I did a lot of projects and there are a lot of webs that I created so far.
    You're more that welcome to give a look on my projects and get some inspiration for your website.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm exciting to work with you and build for you a wonderful website as your request.
    I can promise it will be exactly what you dreamed and even more.
  </p>
